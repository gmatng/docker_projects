# My "docker_projects"

Hi there,
In this Repository **docker_projects** you will find my personal templates that I use to deploy my homelab server. Here all the configurations for the tools, and technologies I leverage in my lab. 

>:warning: Please beware of updates and on the versions of this releases, I will try my best to mantain this repository up to date, but before deploying anything on your own I advise to take a minute and make sure that the versions I am using are still valid and safe.
